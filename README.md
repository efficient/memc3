MemC3
=====

MemC3 is an in-memory key-value cache, derived from Memcached but improved with memory-efficient and concurrent data structures. MemC3 applies multi-reader concurrent cuckoo hashing  as its key-value index and CLOCK-replacement algorithm as cache eviction policy. As a result, MemC3 scales better, runs faster, and uses less memory. For details about the algorithms, performance evaluation and citations, please refer to [our paper in NSDI 2013][1]. For a re-engineered fast, concurrent, stand-alone implementation of concurrent cuckoo hash table, please check our [efficient/libcukoo repository](https://github.com/efficient/libcuckoo).

Authors
=======

MemC3 is developed by Bin Fan, David G. Andersen, and Michael Kaminsky. You can also email us at [libcuckoo-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:libcuckoo-dev@googlegroups.com).

Requirements
============

    $ sudo apt-get install libevent-dev

Building
==========

    $ autoreconf -fis
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If you want to generate optimized build (e.g., with -O2), run ``./configure CFLAGS='-O2'`` instead of ``./configure``
before ``make``. Alternatively, if you want to create debug build (e.g., with -g -ggdb), use ``./configure CFLAGS='-g -ggdb'``


Benchmark
=========

In our [NSDI paper][1], memc3 is benchmared using workloads generated by [Yahoo YCSB][2]. Note that, YCSB is designed to benchmark the performance of cloud file systems, but too slow when used to benchmark memc3 or memcached directly. Therefore, we pre-generate workloads (using script ``bench/ycsb_workloads_gen.sh`` which reads settings in ``bench/ycsb_workloads_settings``), and run clients to read these pre-generated traces before benchmarking.
